A subordinate clause—also called a *dependent clause*—will begin with a _subordinate conjunction_ or a _relative pronoun_ and will contain both a _subject_ and a _verb_. This combination of words will not form a _complete sentence_. It will instead make a reader want additional information to finish the thought.

Here is a list of subordinate conjunctions:

after            once                 until
although         provided that        when
as               rather than          whenever
because          since                where
before           so that              whereas
even if          than                 wherever
even though      that                 whether
if               though               while
in order that 	 unless 	            why
